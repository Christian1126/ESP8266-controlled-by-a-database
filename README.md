# ESP8266-controlled-by-a-database
The main purpose of this project is to develop an alternate control system that allows devices to be controlled locally rather than using cloud servers or hubs as well as, increase flexibility to change inputs and outputs. In short, the ESP will be used to pull commands from a local database (e.g., MySQL), interpret and send signals to the devices. The data can include the time to perform an action and what it will do at that time. For example, the system can turn a fan on/off at certain time frames. This project is partially finished, so controlling physical devices is not completed yet, however, the concept can be demonstrated with LEDs. 

Requried Software/Hardware for project:
  Xampp and run MyPHPadmin, apache, and MySql
  Arduino IDE
  and a text editor (e.g. notepadd++)
  Adafruit Feather huzzah ESP8266

A special thanks to my professor Dr. Boonsuk, who helped me a great deal finishing this project.
